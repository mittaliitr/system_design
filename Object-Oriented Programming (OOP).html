<h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
<p>
  A programming paradigm based on organizing software as a collection of objects, which are instances of classes. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.
</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Classes and Objects:</b> Classes are blueprints for objects; objects are instances containing data (attributes) and behavior (methods).</li>
  <li><b>Interfaces:</b> Define a contract of methods that implementing classes must provide, enabling polymorphism and flexible code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inheritance:</b> Mechanism where a class derives properties and behavior from another class, promoting code reuse.</li>
  <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> Ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same interface or superclass, allowing for flexible and interchangeable code.</li>
  <li><b>Abstraction:</b> Hides complex implementation details and exposes only necessary features, simplifying system complexity.</li>
  <li><b>Encapsulation:</b> Bundles data and methods within a class and restricts direct access to some of the object's components, enhancing security and modularity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Aggregation:</b> Represents a "has-a" relationship where one class contains references to other classes, but those classes can exist independently.</li>
  <li><b>Composition:</b> Stronger form of aggregation where the contained objects cannot exist independently of the container.</li>
  <li><b>Association:</b> General relationship between two classes, indicating that objects of one class can interact with objects of another.</li>
</ul>
