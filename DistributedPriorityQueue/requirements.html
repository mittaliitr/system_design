    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ordered list with per-item priority (not just FIFO)</li>
        <li>Supported operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Modify (priority/data)</li>
        <li>At-least-once delivery (idempotency at job handler level)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scalability: Billions of messages</li>
        <li>Fault tolerance: No single point of failure</li>
        <li>No strict ordering: Ordered processing not guaranteed with multiple consumers</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>ðŸ”„ Ordered vs Unordered Consumption</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With multiple consumers, strict ordering is not feasible</strong> (due to race conditions).</li>
            <li><strong>Priority is approximate, not absolute ordering.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Accept out-of-order execution</strong> to benefit from parallelism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Weâ€™re aiming to build a large-scale priority queue system. To ground this, letâ€™s first talk about some basics.<br><br>
            In traditional FIFO queues-like those managed by ActiveMQ or JMS brokers-message consumption isnâ€™t necessarily ordered. In contrast, systems like Kafka do provide ordering guarantees, but only within a single partition. That means if you have one consumer per partition, the messages within that partition will be consumed in order.<br><br>
            The same concept loosely applies to what weâ€™re trying to do. Can we guarantee that all messages are processed in strict order? <strong>Yes-but only if there's a single consumer.</strong><br><br>
            However, the moment we introduce multiple consumers (which we typically do to scale throughput), we inherently sacrifice strict ordering. Hereâ€™s why: messages are delivered to consumers concurrently. Due to natural race conditions, a later message may get fully processed before an earlier one.
        </p>
        <div style="margin: 1em 0 1em 2em;">
            <strong>Imagine this:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Message A (earlier) is delivered first</li>
                <li>Message B (later) is delivered second</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But due to parallel processing, Message B might be written to the database before Message A, despite being later in the queue. This is a challenge weâ€™ll need to acknowledge and handle.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            That said, perfect ordering is not our goal here.<br>
            Weâ€™re not designing a traditional, strict FIFO queue. We could build a simple in-memory heap if we only needed a single consumer and a strict order. But our requirements are different. Weâ€™re targeting scalable throughput with approximate prioritization, not exact order.<br><br>
            So keep in mind: <strong>our focus is on building an approximate priority queue that works well in a distributed, multi-consumer setup, not one that guarantees perfect ordering of every message.</strong>
        </p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> With multiple consumers, strict ordering is infeasible due to race conditions. Priority is approximate, not absolute. Out-of-order execution is accepted to maximize parallelism.
