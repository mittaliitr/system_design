<h1>Partitioning by Key Range</h1>

<p>
    One way of partitioning is to assign a continuous range of keys (from some minimum to some maximum) to each partition, like the volumes of a paper encyclopedia (Figure 6-2). If you know the boundaries between the ranges, you can easily determine which partition contains a given key. If you also know which partition is assigned to which node, then you can make your request directly to the appropriate node (or, in the case of the encyclopedia, pick the correct book off the shelf).

<p>
    The ranges of keys are not necessarily evenly spaced, because your data may not be evenly distributed. For example, in Figure 6-2, volume 1 contains words starting with A and B, but volume 12 contains words starting with T, U, V, X, Y, and Z. Simply having one volume per two letters of the alphabet would lead to some volumes being much bigger than others. In order to distribute the data evenly, the partition boundaries need to adapt to the data.

    The partition boundaries might be chosen manually by an administrator, or the database can choose them automatically (we will discuss choices of partition boundaries in more detail in “Rebalancing Partitions” on page 209). This partitioning strategy is used by Bigtable, its open source equivalent HBase, RethinkDB, and MongoDB before version 2.4.

    Within each partition, we can keep keys in sorted order. This has the advantage that range scans are easy, and you can treat the key as a concatenated index in order to fetch several related records in one query. For example, consider an application that stores data from a network of sensors, where the key is the timestamp of the measurement (year-month-day-hour-minute-second). Range scans are very useful in this case, because they let you easily fetch, say, all the readings from a particular month.

    However, the downside of key range partitioning is that certain access patterns can lead to hot spots. If the key is a timestamp, then the partitions correspond to ranges of time—e.g., one partition per day. Unfortunately, because we write data from the sensors to the database as the measurements happen, all the writes end up going to the same partition (the one for today), so that partition can be overloaded with writes while others sit idle.
</p>

<p>
    To avoid this problem in the sensor database, you need to use something other than the timestamp as the first element of the key. For example, you could prefix each timestamp with the sensor name so that the partitioning is first by sensor name and then by time. Assuming you have many sensors active at the same time, the write load will end up more evenly spread across the partitions. Now, when you want to fetch the values of multiple sensors within a time range, you need to perform a separate range query for each sensor name.
