<h1>Request Routing and Parallel Query Execution</h1>

<p>Many distributed data systems rely on a separate coordination service such as ZooKeeper to keep track of this cluster metadata, as illustrated in Figure 6-8. Each node registers itself in ZooKeeper, and ZooKeeper maintains the authoritative mapping of partitions to nodes. Other actors, such as the routing tier or the partitioning-aware client, can subscribe to this information in ZooKeeper. Whenever a partition changes ownership, or a node is added or removed, ZooKeeper notifies the routing tier so that it can keep its routing information up to date.</p>

<h2>ZooKeeper for Cluster Coordination</h2>
<p>For example, LinkedInâ€™s Espresso uses Helix [31] for cluster management (which in turn relies on ZooKeeper), implementing a routing tier as shown in Figure 6-8. HBase, SolrCloud, and Kafka also use ZooKeeper to track partition assignment. MongoDB has a similar architecture, but it relies on its own config server implementation and mongos daemons as the routing tier.</p>

<p>Cassandra and Riak take a different approach: they use a gossip protocol among the nodes to disseminate any changes in cluster state. Requests can be sent to any node, and that node forwards them to the appropriate node for the requested partition (approach 1 in Figure 6-7). This model puts more complexity in the database nodes but avoids the dependency on an external coordination service such as ZooKeeper.</p>

<p>Couchbase does not rebalance automatically, which simplifies the design. Normally it is configured with a routing tier called moxi, which learns about routing changes from the cluster nodes [32].</p>

<h2>DNS for IP Address Resolution</h2>
<p>When using a routing tier or when sending requests to a random node, clients still need to find the IP addresses to connect to. These are not as fast-changing as the assignment of partitions to nodes, so it is often sufficient to use DNS for this purpose.</p>

<h2>Parallel Query Execution</h2>

<p>So far we have focused on very simple queries that read or write a single key (plus scatter/gather queries in the case of document-partitioned secondary indexes). This is about the level of access supported by most NoSQL distributed datastores.</p>

<p>However, massively parallel processing (MPP) relational database products, often used for analytics, are much more sophisticated in the types of queries they support. A typical data warehouse query contains several join, filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations. The MPP query optimizer breaks this complex query into a number of execution stages and partitions, many of which can be executed in parallel on different nodes of the database cluster. Queries that involve scanning over large parts of the dataset particularly benefit from such parallel execution.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Parallel Query Execution</h2>
<p>Fast parallel execution of data warehouse queries is a specialized topic, and given the business importance of analytics, it receives a lot of commercial interest. We will discuss some techniques for parallel query execution in Chapter 10. For a more detailed overview of techniques used in parallel databases, please see the references [1, 33].</p>
