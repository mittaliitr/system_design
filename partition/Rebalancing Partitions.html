<h1>Rebalancing Partitions</h1>

<p>Over time, things change in a database:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The query throughput increases, so you want to add more CPUs to handle the load.</li>
  <li>The dataset size increases, so you want to add more disks and RAM to store it.</li>
  <li>A machine fails, and other machines need to take over the failed machine’s responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of these changes call for data and requests to be moved from one node to another.
  The process of moving load from one node in the cluster to another is called <strong>rebalancing</strong>.
</p>

<p>No matter which partitioning scheme is used, rebalancing is usually expected to meet some minimum requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After rebalancing, the load (data storage, read and write requests) should be shared fairly between the nodes in the cluster.</li>
  <li>While rebalancing is happening, the database should continue accepting reads and writes.</li>
  <li>No more data than necessary should be moved between nodes, to make rebalancing fast and to minimize the network and disk I/O load.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategies for Rebalancing</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways of assigning partitions to nodes. Let’s briefly discuss each in turn.</p>

<h3>How not to do it: hash mod N</h3>

<p>
  When partitioning by the hash of a key, it’s best to divide possible hashes into ranges and assign each range to a partition
  (e.g., assign a key to partition 0 if <code>0 ≤ hash(key) &lt; b0</code>, to partition 1 if <code>b0 ≤ hash(key) &lt; b1</code>, and so on).
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps you wondered why we don’t just use mod (the <code>%</code> operator in many programming languages).
  For example, <code>hash(key) mod 10</code> would return a number between 0 and 9. If you have 10 nodes, numbered 0 to 9,
  this seems like an easy way to assign each key to a node.
</p>

<p>
  The problem with the mod N approach is that if the number of nodes <code>N</code> changes, most of the keys need to be moved.
  For instance, if <code>hash(key) = 123456</code>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>With 10 nodes: 123456 mod 10 = 6 (key on node 6).</li>
  <li>With 11 nodes: 123456 mod 11 = 3 (key moves to node 3).</li>
  <li>With 12 nodes: 123456 mod 12 = 0 (key moves to node 0).</li>
</ul>

<p>Such frequent moves make rebalancing excessively expensive. We need a better approach that minimizes data movement.</p>

<h3>Fixed number of partitions</h3>

<p>
  Fortunately, there’s a simple solution: create many more partitions than there are nodes,
  and assign several partitions to each node. For example, a database cluster with 10 nodes
  could be split into 1,000 partitions, with about 100 partitions per node.
</p>

<p>
  When a node is added, it can "steal" a few partitions from every existing node until the partitions are evenly distributed again.
  If a node is removed, the same redistribution happens in reverse.
</p>

<p>
  Only entire partitions are moved between nodes. The number of partitions stays fixed, as does the assignment of keys to partitions.
  The only change is which node is responsible for which partitions.
</p>

<p>
  While data is transferred across nodes, reads and writes continue to use the old assignment until the transfer completes.
</p>

<p>
  You can also accommodate hardware mismatches by assigning more partitions to stronger nodes,
  letting them carry a larger share of the load.
</p>

<p>
  This fixed-partition approach is used in databases like Riak, Elasticsearch, Couchbase, and Voldemort.
</p>

<p>
  In such setups, the number of partitions is usually fixed during database setup and not changed afterward.
  Although in principle you could split and merge partitions, a fixed number simplifies operations.
</p>

<p>
  Choosing the right number of partitions is tricky if dataset size varies a lot over time:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large partitions make rebalancing and recovery expensive.</li>
  <li>Too many small partitions add management overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The best performance is achieved when partitions are “just right” in size—neither too big nor too small—which is
  difficult if partitions are fixed but the dataset size changes significantly.
